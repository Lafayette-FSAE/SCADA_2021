Things to check when trying to a new key that isn't already present in the tables

-Make sure there's a row in the actions table for the new action if it doesn't use one of the old ones.
(e.g as of now there's now std function. So if wanted to add it, would have to add a row for std in actions table)

-Add a row to key_names_table for the key/keyname so that it has a more legible name for graphs and headers

-Add a row to sensor_actions_table that associates the key with the correct sensor id and action id so that it knows
where to pull sensor data from and which action should be executed

-Make sure the desired sensor exists in the Sensor table, so that the data can actually be queried
