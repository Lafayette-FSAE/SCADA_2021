(See Objects.txt for more information on Collectors,Actions, and collectionLists)
Select session:
    -Looks through the data table and determines the sessions available based on the scada:session entries.
     Also collects data about each sessions: duration, start time, etc.
    -Creates a GUI selectable list that holds the available sessions so that user can select the desired session
    -Upon selecting (clicking on) a session from the list, the program collects the requested data and displays it in the report
    -NOTE: Currently, only works on the single provided report template file

Fill collectionLists based on the template:
    -Goes through the template and extracts all the keys
    -For each key, it checks if the Collector for the corresponding key's sensor already exists; if the Collector already exists:
     add the Action for the key to the correct Collector. If the Collector didn't already exist: then create the Collector,
     and add the key's Action to it.
     (In short: create the action for each key and then associate it with the correct Collector)
    -Now exists a list of collectionLists with a Collector and list of Actions

Execute the actions in each collectionList:
    -Run through each collectionList and execute each Action in the list of Actions (collecting the names/values)

Create a copy of the template, and then replace the keys with the requested values from the collectionLists:
    -Creates a copy of the template
    -For each key in the template, replace it with the corresponding name/value from the collectionLists.
    (search through the collectionLists and then their actions to find the corresponding keyname and then retrieve name/value)
