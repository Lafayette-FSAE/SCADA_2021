Collector
    -Holds the available sensor data for a specified sensor for a specified drive session
    -Exists so that actions can be associated with a Collector which collects the data once, instead of each Action
     having to collect the data to compute their values

Actions
    -Can be either Scalar Actions or Graph Actions
    -Holds the key for the action and is meant to be associated with a Collector so that the Collector can provide the
    Action data to be executed
    -Each Action has an execute method to compute the value for the action.

collectionLists
    -A structure which associates a single Collector with a list of Actions so that the corresponding Actions have access
    to the correct data without having to retrieve it a bunch of times
    -Also holds a Graph3, but this should probably be removed or heavily edited to actually a make work. It doesn't really
    work right now at all.

Graph3
    -A specific action to graph 3 sensor data sets
    -This does not extend Action and it isn't a Graph Action
    -It executes a graph function for 3 given data sets which it collects, the 3 sensors whose data is to be collected is
    specified in the actions_table.csv
    -I'll say it again, this Object doesn't really work well at all and should be removed or heavily changed; it existed
    for demo purposes only
