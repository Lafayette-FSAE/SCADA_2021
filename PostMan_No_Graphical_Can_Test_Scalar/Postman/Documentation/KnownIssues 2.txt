1.Doesn't interface with the SCADA system's database, uses a sample database right now. The databases are currently set up
in the same format(at least mostly; there are provided images of the sample database and the simulated one can be adjusted)
but there are other issues that arise when simulating SCADA data. (the issues follow)

2.There isn't a good way of handling if there are 2 scada:session data entries next to each other. This needs to be
handled to either create a "dead" session with no data in it or just not show that sessions since there isn't anything
valuable in it.

3.There isn't a good way of handling if there is no data collected for a requested sensor in the selected session.
(i.e if rpm_max is the used key, but there is no rpm data collection in the selected session data, then there is an error
that isn't handled as of now. Should probably display a default value or maybe some sort of error code that indicates there
was no data for the sensor in the session.)

4.Graph3 doesn't really work, it's mostly there for demonstration purposes. It requires the the graph3 key to be at the
end of the report template to work and even then it only sort of works. This class would need to be completely reworked
or a new idea came up with to be able to generate plots with more than 1 y value.

5.Tool only works for the one, provided report template. This isn't really an issue, just a consideration for a feature that
can be added: selectable report template so you don't have to manually input the template file name.

(There may be other issues, these are just the ones I remember as of now)
